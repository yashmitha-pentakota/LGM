# LGM(lets grow more )

This repository contains two machine learning projects: Iris dataset classification and stock market prediction using a Stacked LSTM model.

## Iris Dataset Classification

In the Iris dataset classification project, we aim to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements. We utilize various machine learning algorithms and compare their performance. The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different Iris species.

### Project Structure

- `iris_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanation of the Iris dataset classification project.
- `iris_data.csv`: CSV file containing the Iris dataset.

### Dependencies

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Stock Market Prediction

In the stock market prediction project, we leverage a Stacked LSTM model to forecast stock prices. The dataset used in this project is historical stock price data for a specific stock. The model is trained on past stock prices to predict future prices.
